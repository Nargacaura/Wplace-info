# How to contribute to the tool?

## In case you find an issue...

2 possibilities can be offered depending on your capabilities to edit code:

- if you **can** solve the issue with a bit of code tweaking, you can fork the repository and make your changes there. Once done, you'll have to **open a PR from your repo to the main one I own**. I'll review the code and test it a bit before rebasing to the main repo.
- if you **can not** edit lines of code to fix it, file an issue using the "Issues" tab, I'll take a look at it and fix them when possible.

## I wanna participate in translating!

Well, you'll need to **fork this repo** and edit the `i18n/locales` folder by adding the desired locale folder (eg. `iu` for Inukitut or `it` for Italian). Once that's been done, you can translate the texts to that language.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For an optimal translation, I recommend that you use **Visual Studio Code or any extension-compatible IDE** that supports **i18n Ally**. This extension is of a great help rapidly translating texts in a language.

One the translations added, don't forget to add a flag in `+page.svelte` so that the language can be changed with the click on it ;) Also, you will have to **open a PR from your repository to mine**, like a bugfix.

## I got ideas!

You can suggest them using the "Discussions" tab, I'll check them whenever possible ;)

I guess that's all I have to say there. Any help is appreciated, so _gÌ±ilakas'la_ to you for helpin' me improving this small QoL tool :)
