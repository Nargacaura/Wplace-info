# Wplace information GUI

## Purpose of this tool

This site's whole purpose is to add a GUI to [Wplace's backend information](https://backend.wplace.live/me), as to render it in a more readable fashion. It is not affiliated to Wplace whatsoever.

## How does this work?

1. Log in to [Wplace](https://wplace.live). That's a crucial step for step 2.
2. Visit [Wplace's user info JSON](https://backend.wplace.live/me) and copy the JSON text (y'know, the thing with `{ "key": "value" }`).
3. Go to [the tool's mini-site](https://nargacaura.github.io/Wplace-info) and paste the text.
4. Click on "Upload Wplace info JSON object", and tada :tada:

## Available languages

The site's available in French and English right now, feel free to fork it to add another language via a pull request :thumbsup:

## Fun fact

Built in Svelte, just like Wplace is :)
