# Wplace information GUI

## Purpose of this tool
This site's whole purpose is to add a GUI to [Wplace's backend information](https://backend.wplace.live/me), as to render it in a more readable fashion. It is not affiliated to Wplace whatsoever.

## Available languages
The site's available in French and English right now, feel free to fork it to add another language (and maybe a language selector instead of a button if that happens) :thumbsup:

## Fun fact
Built in Svelte, just like Wplace is :)
